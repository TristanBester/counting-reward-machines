# Getting Started

This guide will help you get up and running with Counting Reward Machines (CRMs) in your reinforcement learning projects.

## Prerequisites

- Python 3.8 or higher
- Basic understanding of reinforcement learning concepts
- Familiarity with OpenAI Gym/Gymnasium environments

## Installation

Install the package using pip:

```bash
pip install counting-reward-machines
```

## Basic Components

A CRM-based environment consists of three main components:

1. **Ground Environment**: The base environment that defines the state space and dynamics
2. **Labelling Function**: Maps environment states to abstract labels
3. **Counting Reward Machine**: Defines the reward logic based on abstract labels and counters

## Creating Your First Environment

Let's walk through creating a simple environment using the Letter World example:

```python
from examples.letter.ground import LetterWorld
from examples.letter.label import LetterWorldLabellingFunction
from examples.letter.machine import LetterWorldCountingRewardMachine
from examples.letter.crossproduct import LetterWorldCrossProduct

# 1. Create the ground environment
ground_env = LetterWorld()

# 2. Create the labelling function
lf = LetterWorldLabellingFunction()

# 3. Create the CRM
crm = LetterWorldCountingRewardMachine()

# 4. Create the cross-product MDP
env = LetterWorldCrossProduct(
    ground_env=ground_env,
    crm=crm,
    lf=lf,
    max_steps=100,
)

# Use the environment
obs, _ = env.reset()
action = env.action_space.sample()  # Random action
next_obs, reward, terminated, truncated, info = env.step(action)
```
