# Counting Reward Machines

Counting Reward Machines (CRMs) are a powerful formalism for specifying reward functions in reinforcement learning tasks. They extend finite state machines with counting mechanisms, allowing you to express complex temporal and counting behaviors in your reward specifications.

## What are CRMs?

CRMs combine:
- **Finite State Machines**: To track progress through sequences
- **Counting Mechanisms**: To track occurrences of events
- **Reward Functions**: To specify when and how much reward to give

This makes them ideal for tasks where rewards depend on:
- Completing sequences of actions in order
- Achieving goals multiple times
- Meeting complex temporal specifications

## Key Features

- **Pure Python Implementation**: Built using standard Python libraries
- **Flexible Integration**: Easy to integrate with existing RL environments
- **Example Environments**: Includes example environments to get started
- **Cross-Product Construction**: Automated construction of cross-product MDPs
